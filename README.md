# Vehicle-Insurance-Mini-Project

## Project Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) project focused on understanding customer behavior in the vehicle insurance sector. The analysis uses a large anonymized dataset featuring customer demographics, vehicle characteristics, insurance history, claim outcomes, and more.

The main goal is to uncover meaningful insights about factors influencing insurance acceptance and claim patterns to support business strategy and predictive modeling.

## Key Features and Insights
- Analyzed the impact of **prior insurance coverage** and **vehicle damage history** on acceptance rates.
- Identified that customers with **vehicles aged 1-2 years** and **middle-aged individuals (30-45 years)** show the highest insurance uptake.
- Explored how **regional differences** and **policy sales channels** affect acceptance trends.
- Found **premium amounts** show little variance based on claims, highlighting pricing challenges.
- Discovered only moderate gender effects and low multicollinearity among features, useful for further modeling.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebooks
